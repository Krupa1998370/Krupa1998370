In Android development, the animation XML file should be placed in the res/anim folder (not a zip file or any other format). Hereâ€™s a clearer breakdown:

1. Folder Structure:

Path: app/src/main/res/anim/

File: card_reveal.xml



2. Steps:

Create the Folder: In your Android project, navigate to app/src/main/res/ and create a folder named anim if it doesn't already exist.

Add the File: Save your animation XML code in a file named card_reveal.xml within the anim folder.



3. Using the Animation in Your Code:

Java/Kotlin: Reference the XML file in your activity or fragment to apply the animation to a view.




Example:

Animation anim = AnimationUtils.loadAnimation(this, R.anim.card_reveal);
view.startAnimation(anim);

or

val anim = AnimationUtils.loadAnimation(this, R.anim.card_reveal)
view.startAnimation(anim)

This setup ensures that Android can locate and apply your animation correctly.
